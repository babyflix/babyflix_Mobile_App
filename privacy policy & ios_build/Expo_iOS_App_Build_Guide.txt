**Expo iOS App: Build and Install Guide on iPhone (via TestFlight)**


* Step 1: Prepare the Expo App for iOS Build

1. Make sure your Expo project has a valid `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
2. Inside it, configure the iOS section:

json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "YourAppName",
    "slug": "your-app",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourname.yourapp"
    }
  }
}


* Step 2: Build the iOS App using EAS

1. Install EAS CLI:

- bash
  npm install -g eas-cli

2. Log in to your Expo account:

- bash
  eas login

3. Configure EAS for iOS:

- bash
  eas build:configure

4. Start the iOS build:

- bash
  eas build --platform ios

- You'll be asked to log in to your Apple Developer account.
- EAS will manage certificates and provisioning profiles.
- After the build finishes, you will get a `.ipa` file download link.


* Step 3: Upload App to App Store Connect via Transporter

1. Create an App in App Store Connect:

- Visit: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/
- Go to "My Apps" > click "+" > select "New App"
- Fill in the following:
  - "Name": Your app name
  - "Bundle ID": Must match what you used in `app.json`
  - "SKU": Unique ID (e.g. `yourapp2025`)
  - Create the app

2. Use Transporter App:

- Download "Transporter" from the Mac App Store.
- Open it and log in with your Apple Developer account.
- Drag and drop the `.ipa` file into Transporter.
- Click "Deliver" to upload.


Step 4: Enable TestFlight Testing

1. In "App Store Connect", go to your app.
2. Navigate to the "TestFlight" tab.
3. You’ll see the uploaded build. Click it and start internal testing.

4. Add Yourself as a Tester:

- Under "Internal Testing", click "Add Tester".
- Add your Apple ID.

* Step 5: Install the App via TestFlight on iPhone

1. On your iPhone, download "TestFlight" from the App Store.
2. Open TestFlight – your app should appear.
3. Tap "Install" to get the app on your iPhone.

* Notes:

- Requires an active "Apple Developer account ($99/year)".
