We use different types of technologies to collect this information, including single-pixel GIFs. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate when the user closes the browser. Under other circumstances, including if you select the “Remember Me” option upon login, we use a persistent cookie, for example, to store your login ID (but not your password) to allow you to automatically login when you come back to BabyFlix. You can set your browser to refuse cookies; however, if you do so, some or all of the Web Site may not function properly or at all.

    When you use BabyFlix, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit Personal Information through various channels. We collect Personal Information related to these services so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain the Personal Information so that, for instance, you can view a list of your friends or see the books you are currently contributing to. When you update your Personal Information, we sometimes keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.
     
    You post Personal Information in User Content on the Web Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your content, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your content and Personal Information.

We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Web Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.
    If you choose to use our invitation service to tell friends about our Web Site or invite them to collaborate on a book, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. Your friend will automatically be sent a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Web Site. BabyFlix stores information gathered during this process to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at support@babyflix.net to request that we remove your friend’s information from our database.
